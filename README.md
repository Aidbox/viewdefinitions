## Contributions

Each commit should adhere a variation of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary), with only requirements:
- use commit type prefix (eg `feat: ...`)
- specify issue ref (eg `feat(#1): ...`)
- body is optional

NOTE: each commit should not address more than one issue!
